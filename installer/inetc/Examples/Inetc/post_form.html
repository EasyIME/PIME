<title>Registration form for post.php test</title>
</head>
<body>
This form sends POST request to server. It was interesting to compare server echo <br>
reply (by included post.php) for this form and InetLoad plug-in - in my <br>
tests server did not see any difference between them :)<br> 
<form name="MainLogin" action="/post.php?lg=ami&pw=333" method="post">

<input type="text" name="login" value="" tabindex="1"><br>
<input type="password" name="passwd" value="" tabindex="2"><br>
<input type="submit" name="In" value="Enter"  tabindex="3">

</form>
